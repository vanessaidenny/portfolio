<h1>About Me</h1>
<section>
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>What drives my work ethic is building products that are user centered.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Graduated in Business Management, Systems Analysis and Development, and currently studying Interactive Media Design
    at Algonquin College.</p>
  <br>
  <p>I started working in the technology area assisting internal users in solving IT problems and applying training,
    where I proactively started writing and updating internal pages with IT guidelines to contribute to the support
    queue and make users more autonomous.</p>
  <br>
  <p>After the extra time studying programming, I was able to work on building applications and mobile features with
    Angular-Typescript by interpreting design guidelines in Figma and accessibility standards according to WCAG 2.0.</p>
  <br>
  <p>My interaction with design experts made me curious to expand my knowledge in research, ideation, wireframing and
    prototyping.</p>
