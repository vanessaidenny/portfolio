This final project is to build a responsive website based on my portfolio prototype designed in the UX Design course.
In this project, I was able to put in practice my work experience in Angular and Bootstrap knowledge, in addition to create the application from scratch. The most challenge was optimizing images, and I overcame it by going back to in class material to review this part and search for the best practices.
The process of making the UX research and design all the project brought me the experience I needed to keep learning and reaching the confidence as designer in how to analyze the target users, the website intention and identity, as well as design it as user centered.
